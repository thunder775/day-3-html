                    restaurants to public transportation, are facing existential crises and needing handouts themselves.

                    <p class="news-item-description">The so-called coronavirus curve is far from flat, but for many of the
                        country’s arts organizations, revenue certainly is.

                        Ticket sales are practically nonexistent. Parents are requesting refunds for children’s dance
                        classes.
                        Any live event scheduled for before June is probably canceled, including springtime black-tie galas,
                        which often bring in large chunks of revenue for organizations.

                        So, like other sectors of the economy, arts organizations have been turning to local and federal
                        taxpayers for help, trying to make the case that American culture needs a bailout, too.

                        It has not been an easy sell, coming at a time when many pillars of the economy, from airlines to
                        restaurants to public transportation, are facing existential crises and needing handouts themselves.
                        The
                        $2 trillion federal stimulus deal, which was approved by the Senate on Wednesday and awaits a vote
                        in
                        the House, includes $75 million for the National Endowment for the Arts and $75 million for the
                        National
                        Endowment for the Humanities, which can pass on the money to institutions that need it. Another $50
                        million was designated to the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which distributes funds to
                        museums and libraries</p></div>
